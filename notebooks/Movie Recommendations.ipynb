If there are grouped together, we would have to have exact matches to be meaningful (think of label encoding). Since we might want to recommend a movie that is both a thriller and a comedy to someone who watched an animation and a comedy, we want these genres to be separate."

    "Next we will label encode the tags. There are many different ones, however there is some overlap. I considered using word2Vec, but decided that there wasn't enough context to make it meaningful. I may not use these because the true value would be added by adding meaning to the words. For instance, if we had three movies that were tagged \"boring\", we wouldn't want to recommend the other boring movies. Potentially, we could deduce this without NLP by looking at the rating a user gave a movie and then associating a tag as positive, negative or neutral. For example, if a user rated a movie < 3 and tagged it \"boring\", we could make an assumption that the tag \"boring\" is negative, then we wouldn't want to recommend movies that have that tag. While an interesting possibility, the implementation of this feature is outside of the scope of this project (at least with my current Python skills)."

    "Next let's add a column showing the average rating for each movie. This will add value by creating a single rating for a movie that we can tack on as a column to the movies dataframe. In general, people enjoy watching good movies, so having a high average rating would imply that more people would enjoy that movie. It is also important to consider the number of ratings a movie has. If Star Wars had an average rating of 1 out of 5, that wouldn't seem correct. But if we saw that there was only one rating total, then we conclude that it doesn't necessarily represent the opinion of the masses. The average rating will be considered more accurate if there is a higher rating count."

We drop the weightedRating, rating count, and average rating for training because we would prefer to recommend good movies (with a higher rating). Just because someone watches a 1 star movies doesn't mean that should be our recommendation focus. These will reappear later. The final step is to determine how many clusters we should use for the KMeans model. To do this, we generate an elbow graph."

    "In this notebook, we generated models to provide recommendations of similar movies, given a movie. To recap, the use case could be if a streaming video service user finishes the movie The Incredibles, we could plug in The Incredibles data and receive a list of similar movies, sorted by average rating. As can be observed, the primary feature these models are trained on are the genres, then they are sorted by average rating in their resulting clusters. Extensions could include adding the tags as were described in section 2 of this notebook, looking at how individual users rated each movie and make the model input user AND movie, thereby increasing the level of recommendation personalization, and/or adding additional requirements to the cluster results (ie the age rating \"safety-check\" described above). However, our models generated meaningful results and could serve as a baseline for future recommendation engines."
